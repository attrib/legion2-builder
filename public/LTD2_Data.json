            "description": "A Proton, nicknamed for its structural similarities to the positive subatomic particle, is only visible because of the strong energy field orbiting its extremely tiny core. This field typically appears as a yellow cloud of energy, which is often brightened by snaking sea-green rays of oppositely charged energy. |n|nThe Proton typically hovers, its light core buoyant in most environments, and it is so small it can pass through most solid objects. Despite its small physical size, a Proton’s relatively immense energy output allows it to emit powerful shocks when attacked by an enemy, before the foe can react. |n|nA Proton is typically attracted to others of its kind, who emit the same particular patterns and wavelengths of light as it does. Groups of Protons gather around Nova, especially visible at night, often appearing as an unusually bright cluster of stars in the sky, or a dense thicket of bioluminescent plankton just off the shoreline at sea.

The atom is still small enough that it can phase through solid materials, though its movements tend to disrupt space, creating a wake of distinctive ionic pockets. |n|nWhile a great amount of force is required to hold an Atom together, its core is surprisingly stable, formed of a hyper efficient hexahedral structure. The core vents this copious excess energy continuously, releasing super-bright blue particles that orbit within an Atom’s energy field. An Atom’s core structure acts as a focusing lens in times of need, giving it the ability to emit powerful and incredibly accurate particle blasts.",

Within the suit is advanced tech that is capable of surveying the battlefield and communicating essential information to the soldier. The mech suit is hooked up to mimic the actions of the user. This allows the soldier to enact precise movements in combat without relying on clunky commands. |n|nOn the battlefield, Veterans position themselves in the middle line along with Pyros. They use their weapons to gun down enemies while staying relatively clear of incoming fire. Despite the soldiers’ diminutive size, Veterans are not to be trifled with.",

Mounted on top of the module is a large compressor into which the incandescent coolant flows through six arterial pipes. |n|nThe power flow generated by the APS consists of a pure white light emitting from its pink crystalline core. Its current purpose was not anticipated by its original designers: when an old APS power flow is introduced into an up-to-date, self-powered Ex Tech battle machine, an electro-chemical supercharge effect results in unheard-of firing speeds with negligible rises in system heat.|n|nIts wheels, composed of an adaptive alloy of a shifting blue color, contain six small coolant bays, causing them to glow with the APS’s signature blue light. Though able to defend itself with its two classic chain guns mounted atop the compressor shaft, the APS is primarily focused on energizing friendly Mechs, allowing them to dominate on the field of battle.",

They use their agility to maneuver behind enemy lines and strike at vulnerable, unsuspecting foes. |n|nTheir weapons are swords with flairs of energy protruding from the base.

This allows the chassis to ride backwards and “pull” the heavy, eight wheel treads up and away from the ground underneath. |n|nThe cannon is unmistakably Goliath-class: an Ex-Tech design which fires large, explosive shells that are replicated on-site within the tank’s robotics core, allowing it to fire continuously during long battles. |n|nA Millennium’s armor is painted with a reflective agent, which gives off its characteristic blue sheen. Other components, including the two frontal plasma cannons as well as the tank’s wheels, boast the teal of a nanite coating, designed to augment its already tough battle armor. The Millennium’s resulting strength has made it one of the most decorated Mechs in Nova’s history.",

Augmented with the sharpened bones of past enemies, its barrel-chested breastplate serves as a deadly wrecking ball should an enemy survive a blow from its axe. A Bone Crusher equips armor with such bulk to communicate its superiority as a warrior.|n|nAt its peak in battle, a Bone Crusher will go on a rampage, chaining together a flurry of blows – with each kill propelling the warrior more viciously into the melee. While it lacks the swiftness of its other skeletal cousins, its sheer size and savagery more than make up for the difference. ",

Its shell is a mottled orange color, blending in with the sand and rocks of the ocean’s edges, with hints of green and blue to give it added camouflage when foraging for food in shallow waters. Using two blowholes placed under the body at the joints of its middle legs, a Crab can breathe freely in open air, while it filters oxygen from water through its mouth when not on land. |n|nIts claws, though sharp, are operated by weak joints used only to dig through sand and push away other Crabs feeding in the same area. This, and its deceptively weak armor, make a Crab a less than alarming danger. |n|nWhile typically they hide from predators among the rocks and corals of the shallows, when threatened they swarm in large numbers, often only to be slaughtered and eaten by any larger foe.",

During the morning and in the evening, Hoppers can be seen moving towards the sea from the tree-line, leaping into the water, where they are quite nimble thanks to their webbed dorsal fans. |n|nA Hopper typically has large eyes that bulge outward to give it a nearly complete view of its surroundings at all times. Its skin tone is a purple with various shades that change along its body. Yellow stripes run up its dorsal fan, and green rings surround its shoulders, knees, and toes. A Hopper is characterized by its hair-like feelers spanning the top of its eyes and its chin, which it grooms in order to attract mates.|n|nHoppers typically use their tongues to catch insects in the forest or micro-organisms in the sea, flicking them out at immense speeds. The tongue is also its primary defense mechanism against predators. Swarms of Hoppers have been known to defeat only the most unsuspecting warriors, pummeling them with tongue-lash after tongue-lash.",

Accompanying this thick armor underneath are tough folds of blubber that can lessen the impact of any blow. Their limbs merely serving the purpose of walking on land when necessary, the Chiefs prefer to use their immense weight and thick tusks in battle.|n|nAmong the Wale, all but the youngest can identify a Chief merely by his tusks’ discoloration, a yellowing created by exposure to the sun and the sea. Over time, the Wale Chiefs also accumulate thick, white, brine-soaked beards and long whiskers. |n|nWhile they relish a good battle, depending on the time of year, the Chiefs are also restless to retire to the shores to the south, a journey they undertake in groups, carrying only what can fit in their ceremonial baskets, mounted upon walking sticks. They sport a trio of ceremonial feathers, whose colors signify an amphibian’s respect for both land and sea.",

It moves using two wide triangular treads, which lift the body off the ground enough to wade through high waters or thick jungle brush.|n|nWith their original purpose lost due to long-term memory fragmentation, Drill Golems have become simple scavengers, wandering on the outskirts of metropolises, in junkyards and trash heaps. While the hydraulic claw arm of a Drill Golem grasps and maneuvers chunks of scrap, the heavy nanite-edged drill mounted on its other arm carefully shaves undesirable materials away. When this procedure is finished, the Golem pitches the raw materials into a hatch near its head for processing into fuel, plating, and even paint, to maintain its characteristic electric blue and orange coloration. |n|nWhile Nova sports an abundancy of abandoned structure and debris, Drill Golems are generally drawn to the highest concentration of potential fuel, and in some cases, the search leads them to biological sources – the planet’s living inhabitants.

It stands upright on two hind legs, giving it an imposing height that makes all other creatures seem puny. Its neck and limbs are thick with muscle, and it has grown far too large to fit into its shell. |n|nIts pale purple skin has seldom seen the light of day, as a Maccabeus rarely leaves the deep swamp, where it hibernates for three quarters of the year. Vines grow readily from a Maccabeus’s underbelly, and even from its mouth, planting their roots in its nutrient-rich jaw. In return, the vines conceal the Maccabeus so that it may sleep undisturbed.|n|nBecause of this behavior, a Maccabeus is easily mistaken for a land formation. The few eyewitness accounts of an active Maccabeus are mistrusted as exaggerated storytelling, for surely its eyes do not glow purple, and it most certainly does not breathe fire.",

Though intimidating, both the back plates and tail are rather fragile, and a Dino does not rely on them for protection or use them as weapons.|n|nInstead, a Dino’s defense comes in the form of its blue spittle. Dino spittle is strongly alkaline, which helps it pre-digest plants as it chomps on them with its stubby teeth. Coincidentally, it can also dissolve flesh, causing intense pain on contact. A Dino can belch its spittle from a distance, making it a potent threat.|n|nA Dino is bulky, its gait lumbering, and its luminescent frontal horn is easily seen from afar. Most creatures are wise enough to steer clear of a Dino and let it be.",

            "description": "The Mimic is a combined organism whose individual members live together symbiotically. Its primary structure is a neurologically simple being composed of bone, muscle, and cartilage that takes the shape of a chest. Its outside is covered in colonies of lichen that give it a wooden texture, tinged green by moss, and layered just on the inside of the rim are rows of sharp, serrated teeth. |n|nMaking its home on the inside of the chest structure is a community of carnivorous vines. Some appear larger and older and branch out at the ends, secreting digestive acids in order to grasp prey or surfaces. Others are thick and singular – agile enough to serve as legs, propelling the creature at unlikely speeds. Another type has what appear to be flowers on the end that open to reveal free-moving eyes, with which the Mimic spies prey in any direction. |n|nExtremely fast and well armored, it propels itself by use of thick, agile vines, and uses its exoskeletal chest as both a shield and battering ram. The Mimic’s viciousness and many weapons make it capable of taking on creatures two and even three times its size. Its savage temperament can be attributed to the fact that in defending itself, it defends the many minor lifeforms that make it up. ",

It has a large, diamond-shaped forehead that is brawny with muscle, and marked with a similar yellow pattern. Between its forehead and jaws are two spherical, bulbous eyes on either side.|n|nEach of a Kraken’s eight tentacles move independently. A Kraken uses its tentacles to swim as well as to seize its prey. Its tentacles then ooze a sweet-smelling poison that saps whatever strength the prey still has left.|n|nA Kraken lives in the depths of the ocean, and it only surfaces when desperately hungry.",

Its shell is a mottled orange color, blending in with the sand and rocks of the ocean’s edges, with hints of green and blue to give it added camouflage when foraging for food in shallow waters. Using two blowholes placed under the body at the joints of its middle legs, a Crab can breathe freely in open air, while it filters oxygen from water through its mouth when not on land. |n|nIts claws, though sharp, are operated by weak joints used only to dig through sand and push away other Crabs feeding in the same area. This, and its deceptively weak armor, make a Crab a less than alarming danger. |n|nWhile typically they hide from predators among the rocks and corals of the shallows, when threatened they swarm in large numbers, often only to be slaughtered and eaten by any larger foe.",

Characterized by a green exoskeleton with partitions shaped like the furled leaves of plants, a Scorpion’s coloration and silhouette often allow it to comb tall grasses completely undetected. The powerful toxin held in the head of its stinger allows a Scorpion to take down critters much larger than itself. Its small claws and pincers are mainly used to pick apart its prey, often taking a day or more to finish its meal. |n|nA Scorpion hunts not with superior speed or eyesight – its ten eyes offer little in the way of vision – but with cunning and awareness of ground vibrations. Sitting still, unwary travelers have mistaken Scorpions’ tails for fiddle-ferns, only spotting the venomous point at the last moment. Two or three stings from the tail is enough to cripple a much larger foe.",

The same mechanism allows it to grip objects with its four-fingered, humanoid hands, and use its wavelike tail to direct its motion. In order to maintain itself above water, an Aqua Spirit absorbs moisture vapor from the surrounding atmosphere. |n|nAt home in rivers and lakes, Aqua Spirits are comfortable in each other’s company. They can often be seen playing together in merriment, emitting great, complex fountains and sending jets of water at one another. When threatened, however, an Aqua Spirit increases the intensity of these water jets, firing high-speed bolts of water that ricochet to nearby foes. ",

A Rogue Wave is a dark, fluid form that mimics the lifeforms it finds in the deep, open sea by emitting a malicious purple glow. Years in isolation have darkened the color of its once crystal-blue body, as well as its behaviors. |n|nA Rogue Wave, encountering an intruder, will become incensed. In this state, the golem uses its elemental affinity to form huge, steep waves, which crash forth from its hands. Even the largest cargo freighters that make the mistake of trespassing into a Rogue Wave’s domain will find themselves capsized by its cataclysmic fury. ",

The powerful toxin held in the head of its stinger allows a Scorpion to take down critters much larger than itself. Its small claws and pincers are mainly used to pick apart its prey, often taking a day or more to finish its meal. |n|nA Scorpion hunts not with superior speed or eyesight – its ten eyes offer little in the way of vision – but with cunning and awareness of ground vibrations. Sitting still, unwary travelers have mistaken Scorpions’ tails for fiddle-ferns, only spotting the venomous point at the last moment.
